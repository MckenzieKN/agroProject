			This website was made by Kaitlin McKenzie from scratch using html and css. 
			Unit 1 Final Project<br><br>Part 1: An educational item where you communicate your understanding of the differences and similarities between the terms native, non-native, weed, invasive plant, and noxious, communicate why invasions are difficult to detect, what the phases of invasion are, and how invasions happen. At this point in time, please adhere to the classical paradigm of what "invasive" means as put forth by the United States government.<br><br>Part 2: A educational item where you provide the "story" of invasion associated with your plant from the pre-assignment. Your "story" will include information about the introduction of the plant to your country and how its biological features helped lead the plant to success. You need to include at least one theory of invasion fits your invasive plant's history of invasion and you need to make clear, explicit connections between the biological features of your plant and what it means your plant was able to do. <br><br>References found at the bottom of the "Cat's Claw Creeper" Page
