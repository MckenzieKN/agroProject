			Phases of Invasion (refer to the diagram above)<br><br>Transport: Getting the plant or the seeds to a new place<br>		-Modes of transportation:<br>	   -Natural: Floods, wind, animals, etc<br>	   -Human: Horticulture, shoe traffic, seed contaimination, etc<br><br>Introduction: successfully having the plant live in the new place<br><br>Establishment: The process of surviving and reproducing in the new environment<br><br>Spread: The plant becomes invasive by excessive reproduction and ability to quickly spread to nearby locations.<br><br>The "Tens Rule" : 1/1000 of transported plants become invasive.<br>Invasions are hard to spot early on because by the time we realize a species is invasive, it has already spread and started to negatively affect the environment or other aspects of society.<br><br>Theories of Invasion:<br>Empty niche or disturbance<br>Absense of enemies<br>Novel Weapons that native organisms aren't used to<br>Propagule Pressure ("success in numbers")<br>Invasional Meltdown: one new organisms comes in a breaks down the ecosystem<br>Phenotypic Plasticity
